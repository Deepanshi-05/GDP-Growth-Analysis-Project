# GDP-Growth-Analysis-Project
Overview
The GDP Growth Analysis Project is a data analysis and visualization project that explores the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of various countries over time. GDP is a crucial indicator of economic performance, representing the total value of all goods and services produced within a country over a specific period. This project aims to analyze GDP growth, compare GDP across different countries, and visualize the data using interactive plots.

Project Objectives
Analyze GDP Growth: Understand how the GDP of various countries has grown or contracted over time.
Compare GDP: Compare GDP figures across different countries to gauge economic performance.
Visualize Data: Use Plotly to create interactive visualizations that make exploring GDP trends and comparisons easy.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains GDP data for multiple countries over several years. It includes the following key columns:

Country Name: The name of the country.
Year: The year of the GDP data.
Value: The GDP value for the specified year and country.
Dataset Walkthrough
Before diving into the analysis, we performed a dataset walkthrough to understand the contents and identify any issues or limitations that could affect the analysis. This step is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the results.

Analysis Methodology
1. GDP Growth Calculation
GDP Growth Rate: Calculated as the percentage change in GDP from one period to the next using the formula:
GDP Growth Rate
=
GDP in the current period
−
GDP in the previous period
GDP in the previous period
×
100
GDP Growth Rate= 
GDP in the previous period
GDP in the current period in the previous period
​
 ×100
This metric allows us to measure the economic expansion or contraction of a country over time.
2. Comparing GDP Across Countries
Global Comparison: Visualization of GDP figures for all countries in the dataset to understand the relative economic size.
Country-Specific Comparison: Focused comparison between specific countries, such as India and China, to analyze their economic trajectories over time.
3. Data Visualization Using Plotly
Interactive Graphs: Leveraging Plotly to create interactive line charts and bar charts that allow users to explore GDP trends dynamically.
Specific Comparisons: Visualizing GDP comparisons between selected countries using line graphs.
